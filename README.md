# Lead Conversion Analysis Case Study

This repository contains a case study focused on analyzing lead conversion data and providing strategic recommendations to improve conversion rates. The project follows a structured approach, including data processing, feature engineering, model building, and insights generation.

## Overview

The aim of this case study is to analyze lead conversion data and derive actionable strategies to enhance conversion rates. By leveraging data analytics techniques, we clean the dataset, perform exploratory data analysis, and build predictive models.

## Data Processing and Preparation

### 1. **Data Import and Understanding**
   - We start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset to understand the structure of the data.
   
### 2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.
   - Remove unnecessary columns and duplicate entries to ensure the data is clean.

### 3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Categorical variables are converted to numerical ones using dummy variables.
   - Defined predictor variables (X) and target variable (y) to represent lead conversion.

### 4. **Data Splitting and Scaling**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model on unseen data.
   - Apply **StandardScaler** to scale features for consistency, ensuring compatibility with machine learning models like logistic regression.

## Model Building and Evaluation

### 1. **Feature Selection**
   - We use **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** to identify the most relevant features for lead conversion.
   - Validate features using p-values (retain those < 0.05) and check for multicollinearity using **Variance Inflation Factors (VIF)**.

### 2. **Logistic Regression Model**
   - Build a logistic regression model to predict lead conversion.
   - Evaluate the model performance using metrics like accuracy and recall.

## Key Insights and Recommendations

### High-Potential Leads:
1. **Prioritize Leads from Specific Sources:** Leads from "Welingak Websites" and "Olark Chat" are more likely to convert.
2. **Target Working Professionals:** Leads who are working professionals tend to have higher conversion rates.
3. **Engage High-Engagement Leads:** Leads who spend more time on the website are more interested in the company's offerings.
4. **Follow Up on Recent Interactions:** Leads with recent SMS or phone conversations show higher conversion potential.

### Leads to Deprioritize:
1. **Avoid Low-Interest Leads:** Leads whose decision factors are categorized as "Other" have lower conversion rates.
2. **Less Focus on "Landing Page Submissions":** These leads tend to have a lower intent to convert.
3. **Respect Communication Preferences:** Avoid contacting leads who selected "Do Not Email."

## Conclusion

By focusing on high-potential leads and deprioritizing lower-converting segments, businesses can optimize their lead conversion rates. Targeted engagement strategies and respecting user preferences are essential for driving conversion success.
